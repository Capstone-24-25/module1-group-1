<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>For this project, we looked at data from Hewitson <em>et al.</em> (2021). <em>Blood biomarker discovery for autism spectrum disorder: A proteomic analysis.</em> In this study, they wanted to see if there were differences in the levels of various of proteins between young boys who were in the autism spectrum and those who were typically developing. A total of 1125 proteins were analyzed through various machine learning methods to see which proteins could be identified as blood bio-markers for autism spectrum disorder. For our project, we wanted to look deeper into these different methodologies. We aimed to explore the sensitivity of the results of the different design choices. In order to do this, we first looked further into how outliers affect the overall result and what we can do to minimize their effects. Then, we modified the various methods – T-test, logistical regression, and random forest – to test their accuracy and tested if other methods could further improve accuracy.</p>

<p>Data for this project was obtained from <em>Blood biomarker discovery for autism spectrum disorder: A proteomic analysis</em> which was used as the basis for preprocessing and in class analysis that was done within the context of this class. The study tested 1125 proteins and ran them through various different machine learning methodologies. The goal was to see if any conclusions could be made considering the proteins levels regarding whether these proteins are autism blood biomarkers. They tested 76 boys on the autism spectrum disorder and 78 boys that were typically developing. All participants were aged 18 months to 8 years. The data was collected through a blood draw from each participant. The blood was then centrifuged and tested. 1317 proteins were analyzed and out of those, only 1125 passed the quality control so for the remainder of the tests, only those were considered. A random forest, t-test, and correlation approaches were taken to identify the top 10 predictive proteins from each of the methods. Upon further testing, 9 proteins were identified as the core proteins. The core proteins were then used for further analysis in the study. In the end, the study yielded that the levels of the core proteins were severely different in boys with ASD than those who were TD. Overall, the data does show signs that correlation between proteins and ASD may exist and that these proteins could potentially be considered autism spectrum blood biomarkers.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-published-analysis">Summary of published analysis</h2>
<p>We began with a simple exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing. In the raw data, we notice there are a high amount of outliers and the data is fairly skewed for each protein. To remove the skew, we performed a log transformation as well as normalization by centering and scaling all values. To prevent outliers from drastically impacting our analysis, we trimmed outliers to have a value of -3 or 3 depending on their position. Next, we conducted a more in-depth analysis to determine whether the presence of outliers can be explained by any other variables. First, we identified subjects with extremely high outlier count to check for any patterns. To see whether group affects outlier count, we compare the mean and median outlier counts between TD and ASD subjects. Finally, we checked to see if there is correlation between ADOS score and outlier count. Ultimately, we did not find any logical explanation for the outliers.</p>
<p>For the second part of our analysis, we examine whether different methodologies for protein selection will result in better model performance. The first methodology change involves using a train-test split, where 80% of the data is used for model training and the other 20% for testing accuracy. This resulted in a 0.774 accuracy, which is worse than the original analysis. Next, we increased the number of proteins to be chosen during the selection process. The original method used the top 10 proteins from each procedure, and we tried selecting anywhere from 11-30 proteins. We found that selecting more proteins tends to increase accuracy up to 0.96 at 26 proteins, after which accuracy begins to drop off. Finally, we tested out a fuzzy intersection when determining the best combination of proteins across all selection methods. This method generates a panel of 9 proteins(“DERM” “IgD” “TSP4” “C1QR1” “PTN” “FSTL1” “RET” “MAPK14” “CSK”) but does not significantly improve accuracy.</p>
<p>Finally, we used a combination of selecting more proteins and a fuzzy intersection. We selected the top 20 predictive proteins from each of the methods and chose the proteins common to all three methods. Then we removed any proteins that were outside of the top 10 for all 3 methods. For example, if a protein was top 10 in one method and not top 10 in the other two methods, it would be included. If a protein was in the top 20 but not top 10 across all three methods, it would be excluded. This generates a panel of 5 proteins(“DERM” “IgD” “TSP4” “PTN” “FSTL1”) with an improved accuracy of 0.839.</p>

<section id="impact-of-preprocessing-and-outliers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-of-preprocessing-and-outliers">Impact of preprocessing and outliers</h3>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> The main reason for log-transforming the protein levels in biomarker-raw.csv is to ensure that the model is linear. It helps to reduce the skew of the data which in turn helps handle outliers. This allows for the analysis to be simpler. Log-transformation compresses the data which can be seen in the preprocessing script. This will ideally make visualizing the distributions of the various proteins simpler and reduce any outliers that may be present. Looking at the raw distributions for the sample of proteins, we can see that the values are much larger than in the log-transformation version.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> The mean outlier count among all 154 subjects was roughly 15.45. There were some outlier subjects that had an exceedingly high number of outliers, in particular 7 subjects with over 50. Of these outlier subjects, 5 of them were from the TD group while 2 of them were from the ASD group. The mean outlier count for the entire ASD group was 13.25, compared to 17.59 in the TD group. Therefore, it appears that subjects in the TD group tend to have more frequent outliers. Considering there are over 1300 proteins in the dataset, this difference does not seem significant. This difference can be explained by the greater presence of outlier subjects in the TD group, which skews the value of the mean upward. If we look at the median, which is less impacted by outliers, both groups have the exact same median count of 8.5.</p>
<p>We were also curious to examine whether ADOS score had any correlation with the outlier count of ASD subjects. Visually, there does not appear to be any relationship between these 2 variables. Since outlier count by subject is not dependent on group or ADOS score, we conclude that the presence of outliers is completely random.</p>

<section id="methodlogical-variations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodlogical-variations">Methodlogical variations</h3>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong></p>
<p>We carried out the entire selection procedure on a training partition, and tested the final model on the testing set. The results show that the model has a predictive accuracy of 0.774, which is lower than the in-class analysis where the selection procedure is carried out on the entire data set.</p>
<p>First, we tried to split the data set into <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span> training set and <span class="math inline">\(20\%\)</span> validation set. Then we tried for different numbers of top predictive proteins using each selection method to train our model. For 10-30 numbers of proteins, the accuracy increases with the number of proteins until the accuracy starts to decrease after the number of proteins is 26. When we pick 26 top predictive proteins, we can get a <span class="math inline">\(96\%\)</span> accuracy on the validation set.</p>
<p>Then, we also explored using a fuzzy intersection instead of a hard intersection to combine the sets of top predictive proteins across selection methods. We did this through the stringdist_inner_join function in the “fuzzyjoin” package, using the Jaro-Winkler similarity scores. After tuning we decided that the best maximum allowed distance for the fuzzy intersection is around 0.46, which produced an intersection with 9 proteins “DERM” “IgD” “TSP4” “C1QR1” “PTN” “FSTL1” “RET” “MAPK14” “CSK”, instead of the 4 protein hard intersection. However, the logistic regression shows that this panel of proteins does not significantly improve the prediction accuracy.</p>
</section>
<section id="improved-classifier" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="improved-classifier">Improved classifier</h3>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong></p>
<p>Our attempt was to use 20 top proteins for each method and used a different intersection method. We took the hard intersection of the 20 top proteins from each and then removed any protein that is not in the top 10 predictive proteins for either method. This gives us a 5-protein panel: “DERM” “IgD” “TSP4” “PTN” “FSTL1”, which achieved a better accuracy. The accuracy for the in-class analysis was 0.774 and this panel achieved an accuracy of 0.839.</p>
